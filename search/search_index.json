It is important to build your application with testing in mind.  Here are some tips to help you build for testing:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameterize everything. Rather than hard-code any variables, consider making everything a configurable parameter with a reasonable default. This will allow you to easily change the behavior of your application during testing. Particularly during performance testing, it is common to test different values to see what impact that has on performance. If a range of defaults need to change together, consider one or more parameters which set \"modes\", changing the defaults of a group of parameters together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document at startup. When your application starts up, it should log all parameters. This ensures the person reviewing the logs and application behavior know exactly how the application is configured.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log to console. Logging to external systems like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services. This requires logs to be dispatched from the local system to the external system and that is a dependency that can fail. It is important that someone be able to console logs directly on the local system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log to external system. In addition to console logs, logging to an external system like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services and durability of logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log all activity. If the system is performing some activity (reading data from a database, calling an external service, etc.), it should log that activity. Ideally, there should be a log message saying the activity is starting and another log message saying the activity is complete. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand what the application is doing and how long it is taking. Depending on how noisy this is, different messages can be associated with different log levels, but it is important to have the information available when it comes to debugging a deployed system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Correlate distributed activities. If the system is performing some activity that is distributed across multiple systems, it is important to correlate the activity across those systems. This can be done using a Correlation ID that is passed from system to system. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand the entire flow of activity. For more information, please see Observability in Microservices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log metadata. When logging, it is important to include metadata that is relevant to the activity. For example, a Tenant ID, Customer ID, or Order ID. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand the context of the activity and filter to a manageable set of logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Log performance metrics. Even if you are using App Insights to capture how long dependency calls are taking, it is often useful to know long certain functions of your application took. It then becomes possible to evaluate the performance characteristics of your application as it is deployed on different compute platforms with different limitations on CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. For more information, please see Metrics.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/cdc_testing/cdc_testing/","title":"Consumer-driven Contract Testing (CDC)","text":"<p>Consumer-driven Contract Testing (or CDC for short) is a software testing methodology used to test components of a system in isolation while ensuring that provider components are compatible with the expectations that consumer components have of them.</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/cdc_testing/cdc_testing/#why-consumer-driven-contract-testing","title":"Why Consumer-driven Contract Testing","text":"<p>CDC tries to overcome the several painful drawbacks of automated E2E tests with components interacting together:</p> <ul> <li>E2E tests are slow</li> <li>E2E tests break easily</li> <li>E2E tests are expensive and hard to maintain</li> <li>E2E tests of larger systems may be hard or impossible to run outside a dedicated testing environment</li> </ul> <p>Although testing best practices suggest to write just a few E2E tests compared to the cheaper, faster and more stable integration and unit tests as pictured in the testing pyramid below, experience shows many teams end up writing too many E2E tests.

Here are some of the metrics that you can capture and analyze:</p> Counter Description Avg. Disk Queue Length This value is derived using the (Disk Transfers/sec)*(Disk sec/Transfer) counters. This metric describes the disk queue over time, smoothing out any quick spikes. Having any physical disk with an average queue length over 2 for prolonged periods of time can be an indication that your disk is a bottleneck. % Idle Time This is a measure of the percentage of time that the disk was idle. ie. there are no pending disk requests from the operating system waiting to be completed. A low number here is a positive sign that disk has excess capacity to service or write requests from the operating system. Avg. Disk sec/Read and Avg. Disk sec/Write These both measure the latency of your disks. Latency is defined as the average time it takes for a disk transfer to complete. You obviously want is low numbers as possible but need to be careful to account for inherent speed differences between SSD and traditional spinning disks. For this counter is important to define a baseline after the hardware is installed. Then use this value going forward to determine if you are experiencing any latency issues related to the hardware. Disk Reads/sec and Disk Writes/sec These counters each measure the total number of IO requests completed per second.

This counter can either be too high or too low. If your processor time is consistently below 40%, then there is a question as to whether you have over provisioned your CPU. 70% is generally considered a good target number and if you start going higher than 70%, you may want to explore why there is high CPU pressure. % Privileged (Kernel Mode) time This measures the percentage of elapsed time the processor spent executing in kernel mode. Since this counter takes into account only kernel operations a high percentage of privileged time (greater than 25%) may indicate driver or hardware issue that should be investigated. % User time The percentage of elapsed time the processor spent executing in user mode (your application code). A good guideline is to be consistently below 65% as you want to have some buffer for both the kernel operations mentioned above as well as any other bursts of CPU required by other applications.

Rather than just abstracting the file system entirely, let us think about why we need the file system and abstract the concept rather than the implementation. In this case, we are using the <code>File</code> class to read from the config file, and the config contents. The abstraction concept here is some form or configuration reader that returns each line of the configuration in a string array. We could call it <code>ConfigurationReader</code>, and it has a single method, <code>Read</code>, which returns the contents.</p> <p>When creating abstractions, it can be good practice creating an interface for that abstraction, in languages that support it. In the example with C#, we can create an <code>IConfigurationReader</code> interface, and instead of just having a <code>ConfigurationReader</code> class we can be more specific and name if <code>FileConfigurationReader</code> to indicate that it reads from the file system:</p> <pre><code>// IConfigurationReader.cs\npublic interface IConfigurationReader\n{\n    string[] Read();\n}\n\n// FileConfigurationReader.cs\npublic class FileConfigurationReader : IConfigurationReader\n{\n    public string[] Read()\n    {\n        return File.ReadAllLines(\".config\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now that the file dependency has been abstracted away, we need to update our Configuration class's Initialize method to use the new abstraction instead of calling <code>File.ReadAllLines</code> directly:</p> <pre><code>public void Initialize()\n{\n    var configContents = new FileConfigurationReader().Read();\n\n    // Config is in the format: key=value\n    var config = configContents.Select(l =&gt; l.Split('='))\n                               .ToDictionary(kv =&gt; kv[0], kv =&gt; kv[1]);\n\n    // Assign all properties here\n    this.MyProperty = config[\"myproperty\"];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, we still have a dependency on the file system, but that dependency has been abstracted out.

We can use dependency injection to inject the right reader into our <code>Configuration</code> class:</p> <pre><code>using System.IO;\nusing System.Linq;\n\npublic class Configuration\n{\n    private readonly IConfigurationReader configReader;\n\n    // Public getter properties from configuration object\n    public string MyProperty { get; private set; }\n\n    public Configuration(IConfigurationReader reader)\n    {\n        this.configReader = reader;\n    }\n\n    public void Initialize()\n    {\n        var configContents = configReader.Read();\n\n        // Config is in the format: key=value\n        var config = configContents.Select(l =&gt; l.Split('='))\n                                   .ToDictionary(kv =&gt; kv[0], kv =&gt; kv[1]);\n\n        // Assign all properties here\n        this.MyProperty = config[\"myproperty\"];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Above, a technique was used called Constructor Injection.

This is an example of \"inversion of control\", previously the <code>Configuration</code> object controlled the dependency, but instead we pushed up the control to whatever component creates this object.</p> <p>Note that we injected the interface <code>IConfigurationReader</code> and not the concrete class.

Luckily since we used dependency injection, all we need to do is create an implementation of <code>IConfigurationReader</code> that does not depend on the file system. We could create a mock here, but instead let's create a concrete implementation of the interface which simply returns the passed in string[] - we can call it <code>PassThroughConfigurationReader</code> (for more details on why this approach may be better than mocking, see the page on mocking)</p> <pre><code>public class PassThroughConfigurationReader : IConfigurationReader\n{\n    private readonly string[] contents;\n\n    public PassThroughConfigurationReader(string[] contents)\n    {\n        this.contents = contents;\n    }\n\n    public string[] Read()\n    {\n        return this.contents;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This simple class will be used in our unit tests, so we can create different states without requiring lots of file access.

Let's add some more tests and align the tests with how we think the <code>Configuration</code> class should behave:</p> <pre><code>public class ConfigurationTests\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void Initialize_EmptyConfig_Throws()\n    {\n        var reader = new PassThroughConfigurationReader(Array.Empty&lt;string&gt;());\n        var config = new Configuration(reader);\n\n        Assert.Throws&lt;InvalidOperationException&gt;(() =&gt; config.Initialize());\n    }\n\n    [Fact]\n    public void Initialize_MalformedLine_Throws()\n    {\n        var reader = new PassThroughConfigurationReader(new[] {\n            \"myproperty\",\n        });\n        var config = new Configuration(reader);\n\n        Assert.Throws&lt;InvalidOperationException&gt;(() =&gt; config.Initialize());\n    }\n\n    [Fact]\n    public void Initialize_MultipleEqualSigns_PropertyContainsNoEquals()\n    {\n        var reader = new PassThroughConfigurationReader(new[] {\n            \"myproperty=myval1=myval2\",\n        });\n        var config = new Configuration(reader);\n\n        config.Initialize();\n\n        Assert.Equal(\"myval1=myval2\", config.MyProperty);\n    }\n\n    [Fact]\n    public void Initialize_WithBlankLines_Ignores()\n    {\n        var reader = new PassThroughConfigurationReader(new[] {\n            \"myproperty=myvalue\",\n            string.Empty,\n        });\n        var config = new Configuration(reader);\n\n        config.Initialize();\n\n        Assert.Equal(\"myvalue\", config.MyProperty);\n    }\n\n    [Fact]\n    public void Initialize_CorrectFormat_SetsProperty()\n    {\n        var reader = new PassThroughConfigurationReader(new[] {\n            \"myproperty=myvalue\"\n        });\n        var config = new Configuration(reader);\n\n        config.Initialize();\n\n        Assert.Equal(\"myvalue\", config.MyProperty);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now we have 4 failing tests and 1 passing test, but we have firmly established through the use of these tests how we expect callers to user the Configuration class and what is and isn't allowed as inputs. Now we just need to fix the <code>Configuration</code> class so that our tests pass:</p> <pre><code>public void Initialize()\n{\n    var configContents = configReader.Read();\n\n    if (configContents.Length == 0)\n    {\n        throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Empty config\");\n    }\n\n    // Config is in the format: key=value\n    var config = configContents.Where(l =&gt; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(l))\n                               .Select(l =&gt;\n                               {\n                                   var splitLine = l.Split('=', 2);\n                                   if (splitLine.Length &lt; 2)\n                                   {\n                                       throw new InvalidOperationException(\"Malformed line\");\n                                   }\n                                   return splitLine;\n                               })\n                               .ToDictionary(kv =&gt; kv[0], kv =&gt; kv[1]);\n\n    // Assign all properties here\n    this.MyProperty = config[\"myproperty\"];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now all our tests pass!

The key concept here is that stubs should never fail a unit or integration test where a mock can.

In other words, mocks are a replacement object for the dependency that has certain expectations that are placed on it; those expectations might be things like validating a sub-method has been called a certain number of times or that arguments are passed down in a certain way.</p> <p>Mocking frameworks are abundant for every language, with some languages having mocks built into the unit test packages. They make writing unit tests easy and still encourage good unit testing practices.</p> <p>The main difference between a mock and most of the other test doubles is that mocks do behavioral verification, whereas other test doubles do state verification. With behavioral verification, you end up testing that the implementation of the system under test is as you expect, whereas with state verification the implementation is not tested, rather the inputs and the outputs to the system are validated.</p> <p>The major downside to behavioral verification is that it is tied to the implementation. One of the biggest advantages of writing unit tests is that when you make code changes you have confidence that if your unit tests continue to pass, that you are making a relatively safe change. If tests need to be updated every time because the behavior of the method has changed, then you lose that confidence because bugs could also be introduced into the test code. This also increases the development time and can be a source of frustration.</p> <p>For example, let's assume you have a method that you are testing that makes 5 web service calls. With mocks, one of your tests could be to check that those 5 web service calls were made. Sometime later the API is updated and only a single web service call needs to be made. Once the system code is changed, the unit test will fail because it expects 5 calls and not 1. The test needs to be updated, which results in lowered confidence in the change, as well as potentially introduces more areas for bugs to sneak in.</p> <p>Some would argue that in the example above, the unit test is not a good test anyway because it depends on the implementation, and that may be true; but one of the biggest problems with using mocks (and specifically mocking frameworks that allow these verifications), is that it encourages these types of tests to be written. By not using a mock framework that allows this, you never run the risk of writing tests that are validating the implementation.</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/mocking/#upsides-to-mocking","title":"Upsides to Mocking","text":"<ul> <li>Easy to write.</li> <li>Encourages testable design.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/mocking/#downsides-to-mocking","title":"Downsides to Mocking","text":"<ul> <li>Behavioral testing can present problems with maintainability in unit test code.</li> <li>Usually requires a framework to be installed (or if no framework, lots of boilerplate code)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/mocking/#fakes","title":"Fakes","text":"<p>Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which may make them not suitable for production.

In this sense though, they increase confidence in your code even more because your test double has been thoroughly tested for bugs before you even use it as a downstream dependency.</p> <p>Similarly to mocks, fakes also promote testable design, but unlike mocks they do not require any frameworks to write.

Some assertions can be inefficient and not give you the confidence you need in the test result. When you are mocking a client or configuration and your method passes the mock result directly as a return value without significant changes, consider not asserting on the return value. Because if you do, you are mainly asserting whether you set up the mock correctly. For a very simple example, look at this class:</p> <pre><code>public class SearchController : ControllerBase {\n\n   public ISearchClient SearchClient { get; }\n\n   public SearchController(ISearchClient searchClient)\n   {\n      SearchClient = searchClient;\n   }\n\n   public String GetName(string id)\n   {\n      return this.SearchClient.GetName(id);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>When testing the <code>GetName</code> method, you can set up a mock search client to return a certain value. Then, it\u2019s easy to assert that the return value is, in fact, this value from the mock.</p> <pre><code>mockSearchClient.Setup(x =&gt; x.GetName(id))\n   .ReturnsAsync(\"myResult\");\nvar result = searchController.GetName(id);\nAssert.Equal(\"myResult\",result.Value);\n</code></pre> <p>But now, your method could look like this, and the test would still pass:</p> <pre><code>public String GetName(string id)\n{\n   return \"myResult\";\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, if you set up your mock wrong, the test would fail even though the logic inside the method is sound. For efficient assertions that will give you confidence in your SUT, make assertions on your logic, not mock return values. The simple example above doesn\u2019t have a lot of logic, but you want to make sure that it calls the search client to retrieve the result. For this, you can use the verify method to make sure the search client was called using the right parameters even though you don\u2019t care about the result.</p> <pre><code>mockSearchClient.Verify(mock =&gt; mock.GetName(id), Times.Once());\n</code></pre> <p>This example is kept simple to visualize the principle of making meaningful assertions. In a real world application, your SUT will probably have more logic inside. Pieces of glue code that have as little logic as this example don't always have to be unit tested and might instead be covered by integration tests. If there is more logic and a unit test with mocking is required, you should apply this principle by verifying mock calls and making assertions on the part of the mock result that was modified by your SUT.</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/mocking/#callbacks","title":"Callbacks","text":"<p>It can be time-consuming to set up mocks if you want to make sure they are being called with the right parameters, especially if the parameters are complex. To make your testing more efficient, consider using callbacks to make assertions on the parameters after a method was called. Often you don\u2019t care about all the parameters but only a few, or even only parts of them if the parameters are also objects. It\u2019s easy to make a small mistake in the creation of the parameter, like missing an attribute that the actual method sets, and then your mock won\u2019t be called, even though you might not care about this attribute at all. To avoid this, you can define only the most relevant parameters to differentiate between method calls and use an <code>any</code>-statement for the others. In this example, the method has a complex search options parameter which would take a lot of time to set up manually. Since you only care about 2 attributes in the search options, you use an <code>any</code>-statement and store the options in a callback for later assertions.</p> <pre><code>var actualOptions = new SearchOptions();\n\nmockSearchClient\n   .Setup(x =&gt;\n      x.Search(\n         \"[This parameter is most relevant]\",\n         It.IsAny&lt;SearchOptions&gt;()\n      )\n   )\n   .Returns(mockResults)\n   .Callback&lt;string, SearchOptions&gt;((query, searchOptions) =&gt;\n     {\n       actualOptions = searchOptions;\n     }\n   );\n</code></pre> <p>Since you want to test your method logic, you should care only about the parts of the parameter which are influenced by your SUT, in this example, let's say the search mode and the search query type. So, with the variable you stored in the callback, you can make assertions on only these two attributes.</p> <pre><code>Assert.Equal(SearchMode.All, actualOptions.SearchMode);\nAssert.Equal(SearchQueryType.Full, actualOptions.QueryType);\n</code></pre> <p>This makes the test more explicit since it shows which parts of the logic you care about.

It's important to write the bare minimum of code necessary even if it is not actually \"correct\". Once the test passes you can refactor the code to make it maybe make more sense, but again the logic should be simple. As you write more tests, the logic gets more and more complex, but you can continue to make the minimal changes to the system code with confidence because all code that was written is covered.</p> <p>As an example, let's assume we are trying to write a new function that validates a string is a valid password format. The password format should be a string larger than 8 characters containing at least one number. We start with the simplest possible test; one of the easiest ways to do this is to first write tests that validate inputs into the function:</p> <pre><code>// Tests.cs\npublic class Tests\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void ValidatePassword_NullInput_Throws()\n    {\n        var s = new MyClass();\n        Assert.Throws&lt;ArgumentNullException&gt;(() =&gt; s.ValidatePassword(null));\n    }\n}\n\n// MyClass.cs\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If we run this code, the test will fail as no exception was thrown since our code in <code>ValidateString</code> is just a stub. This is ok! This is the \"Red\" part of Red-Green-Refactor. Now we want to move onto the \"Green\" part - making the minimal change required to make this test pass:</p> <pre><code>// MyClass.cs\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Our tests pass, but this function doesn't really work, it will always throw the exception. That's ok! As we continue to write tests we will slowly add the logic for this function, and it will build on itself, all while guaranteeing our tests continue to pass.</p> <p>We will skip the \"Refactor\" stage at this point because there isn't anything to refactor. Next let's add a test that checks that the function returns false if the password is less than size 8:</p> <pre><code>[Fact]\npublic void ValidatePassword_SmallSize_ReturnsFalse()\n{\n    var s = new MyClass();\n    Assert.False(s.ValidatePassword(\"abc\"));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This test will pass as it still only throws an <code>ArgumentNullException</code>, but again, that is an expected failure. Fixing our function should see it pass:</p> <pre><code>public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n{\n    if (input == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, some code that looks real! Note how it wasn't the test that checked for null that had us add the <code>if</code> statement for the null-check, but rather the subsequent test which unlocked a whole new branch. By adding that if statement, we made the bare minimum change necessary in order to get both tests to pass, but we still have work to do.</p> <p>In general, working in the order of adding a negative test first before adding a positive test will ensure that both cases get covered by the code in a way that can get tests. Red-Green-Refactor makes that process super easy by requiring the bare minimum change - since we only want to make the bare minimum changes, we just simply return false here, knowing full well that we will be adding logic later that will expand on this.</p> <p>Speaking of which, let's add the positive test now:</p> <pre><code>[Fact]\npublic void ValidatePassword_RightSize_ReturnsTrue()\n{\n    var s = new MyClass();\n    Assert.True(s.ValidatePassword(\"abcdefgh1\"));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Again, this test will fail at the start. One thing to note here if that its important that we try and make our tests resilient to future changes. When we write the code under test, we act very naively, only trying to make the current tests we have pass; when you write tests though, you want to ensure that everything you are doing is a valid case in the future. In this case, we could have written the input string as <code>abcdefgh</code> and when we eventually write the function it would pass, but later when we add tests that validate the function has the rest of the proper inputs it would fail incorrectly.</p> <p>Anyways, the next code change is:</p> <pre><code>public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n{\n    if (input == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n\n    if (input.Length &gt; 8)\n    {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we now have a passing test! However, the logic doesn't actually make much sense. We did the bare minimum change which was adding a new condition that passed for longer strings, but thinking forward we know this won't work as soon as we add additional validations. So let's use our first \"Refactor\" step in the Red-Green-Refactor flow!</p> <pre><code>public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n{\n    if (input == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n\n    if (input.Length &lt; 8)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>That looks better. Note how from a functional perspective, inverting the if-statement does not change what the function returns. This is an important part of the refactor flow, maintaining the logic by doing provably safe refactors, usually through the use of tooling and automated refactors from your IDE.</p> <p>Finally, we have one last requirement for our <code>ValidatePassword</code> method and that is that it needs to check that there is a number in the password. Let's again start with the negative test and validate that with a string with the valid length that the function returns <code>false</code> if we do not pass in a number:</p> <pre><code>[Fact]\npublic void ValidatePassword_ValidLength_ReturnsFalse()\n{\n    var s = new MyClass();\n    Assert.False(s.ValidatePassword(\"abcdefghij\"));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Of course the test fails as it is only checking length requirements. Let's fix the method to check for numbers:</p> <pre><code>public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n{\n    if (input == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n\n    if (input.Length &lt; 8)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    if (!input.Any(char.IsDigit))\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we use a handy LINQ method to check if any of the <code>char</code>s in the <code>string</code> are a digit, and if not, return false. Tests now pass, and we can refactor. For readability, why not combine the <code>if</code> statements:</p> <pre><code>public bool ValidatePassword(string input)\n{\n    if (input == null)\n    {\n        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));\n    }\n\n    if ((input.Length &lt; 8) ||\n        (!input.Any(char.IsDigit)))\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As we refactor this code, we feel 100% confident in the changes we made as we have 100% test coverage which tests both positive and negative scenarios. In this case we actually already have a method that tests the positive case, so our function is done!</p> <p>Now that our code is completely tested we can make all sorts of changes and still have confidence that it works. For example, if we wanted to change the implementation of the method to use regex, all of our tests would still pass and still be valid.</p> <p>That is it! We finished writing our function, we have 100% test coverage, and if we had done something a little more complex, we are guaranteed that whatever we designed is already testable since the tests were written first!</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/unit_testing/","title":"Unit Testing","text":"<p>Unit testing is a fundamental tool in every developer's toolbox.

This technique can be used in creating testable design and is used often especially in object-oriented languages. For unit tests, abstraction is commonly used to break a hard dependency and replace it with an abstraction. That abstraction then allows for greater flexibility in the code and allows for the a mock or simulator to be used in its place.</p> <p>One of the side effects of abstracting dependencies is that you may have an abstraction that has no test coverage. This is case where unit testing is not well-suited, you can not expect to unit test everything, things like dependencies will always be an uncovered case. This is why even if you have a robust unit testing suite, integration or functional testing should still be used - without that, a change in the way the dependency functions would never be caught.</p> <p>When building wrappers around third-party dependencies, it is best to keep the implementations with as little logic as possible, using a very simple facade that calls the dependency.</p> <p>An example of using abstraction can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/unit_testing/#dependency-injection","title":"Dependency Injection","text":"<p>Dependency injection is a technique which allows us to extract dependencies from our code. In a normal use-case of a dependant class, the dependency is constructed and used within the system under test. This creates a hard dependency between the two classes, which can make it particularly hard to test in isolation. Dependencies could be things like classes wrapping a REST API, or even something as simple as file access. By injecting the dependencies into our system rather than constructing them, we have \"inverted control\" of the dependency. You may see \"Inversion of Control\" and \"Dependency Injection\" used as separate terms, but it is very hard to have one and not the other, with some arguing that Dependency Injection is a more specific way of saying inversion of control. In certain languages such as C#, not using dependency injection can lead to code that is not unit testable since there is no way to inject mocked objects. Keeping testability in mind from the beginning and evaluating using dependency injection can save you from a time-intensive refactor later.</p> <p>One of the downsides of dependency injection is that it can easily go overboard. While there are no longer hard dependencies, there is still coupling between the interfaces, and passing around every interface implementation into every class presents just as many downsides as not using Dependency Injection. Being intentional with what dependencies get injected to what classes, is key to developing a maintainable system.</p> <p>Many languages include special Dependency Injection frameworks that take care of the boilerplate code and construction of the objects. Examples of this are Spring in Java or built into ASP.NET Core</p> <p>An example of using dependency injection can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"playbook/automated_testing/unit_testing/unit_testing/#test-driven-development","title":"Test-Driven Development","text":"<p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is less a technique in how your code is designed, but a technique for writing your code that will lead you to a testable design from the start.

Having descriptive names such as the one above makes it trivial to find the test when there is a failure, and also already explains what the expectation of the test was and what state caused it to fail.

In general, if your code is flaky without the sleep, consider why it is failing and if you can remove the flakiness by   introducing a more reliable way to communicate potential state changes. Adding sleeps to your unit tests also breaks   one of our original tenets of unit testing: tests should be fast, as in order of milliseconds. If tests are taking on   the order of seconds, they become more cumbersome to run.</li> <li>Reading from disk - It can be really tempting to the expected value of a function return in a file and read that file   to compare the results. This creates a dependency with the system drive, and it breaks our tenet of keeping our unit   tests isolated and 100% reliable. Any outside dependency such as file system access could potentially cause   intermittent failures. Additionally, this could be a sign that perhaps the test or unit under test is too complex and   should be simplified.</li> <li>Calling third-party APIs - When you do not control a third-party library that you are calling into, it's impossible to   know for sure what that is doing, and it is best to abstract it out. Otherwise, you may be making REST calls or other   potential areas of failure without directly writing the code for it. This is also generally a sign that the design of   the system is not entirely testable. It is best to wrap third party API calls in interfaces or other structures so   that they do not get invoked in unit tests.

The prerequisite for this approach to be successful is to have integration tests being able to execute at a speed comparable to that of unit tests both locally and in a CI environment. Modern application frameworks like .NET or Spring Boot combined with the right mocking or stubbing approach for external dependencies offer excellent capabilities to enable such scenarios for testing.</p> <p>Usually, integration tests only prove that independently developed modules connect together as designed. The test coverage of integration tests can be extended to verify the correct behavior of the system as well. The responsibility of providing a sufficient branch and line code coverage can be transferred from unit tests to integration tests. Instead of several unit tests needed to test a specific case of functionality of the system, one integration scenario is created that covers the entire flow. For example in case of an API, the received HTTP responses and their content are verified for each request in test. This covers both the integration between components of the API and the correctness of its business logic.</p> <p>With this approach efficient integration tests can be treated as an extension of unit testing, taking over the responsibility of validating happy/failure path scenarios. It has the advantage of testing the system as a black box without any knowledge of its internals. Code refactoring has no impact on tests. Common testing techniques as TDD can be applied at a higher level which results in a development process that is driven by acceptance tests. Depending on the project specifics unit tests still play an important role.

This makes it easy to introduce drift between the source code and the secrets, e.g. adding a reference to a new secret in code but forgetting to add it to the pipeline variables (leads to confusing build breaks), or deleting a reference to a secret in code and forgetting to remote it from the pipeline variables (leads to confusing pipeline variables).</p> </li> <li> <p>Pipeline variables are global shared state. This can lead to confusing situations and hard to debug problems when developers make concurrent changes to the pipeline variables which may override each other. Having a single global set of pipeline variables also makes it impossible for secrets to vary per environment (e.g. when using a branch-based deployment model where 'master' deploys using the production secrets, 'development' deploys using the staging secrets, and so forth).</p> </li> </ul> <p>A solution to these limitations is to manage secrets in the Git repository jointly with the project's source code. As described in secrets management, don't check secrets into the repository in plain text. Instead we can add an encrypted version of our secrets to the repository and enable our CI/CD agents and developers to decrypt the secrets for local usage with some pre-shared key.

One way it can be done is to have one workflow for multiple environments, but the complexity increases as additional processes and jobs are added to a workflow, which does not mean it cannot be done for small pipelines. The plus point of having one workflow is that, when an artifact flows from one environment to another the state and environment values between the deployment environments can be passed easily.</p> <p></p> <p>One way to get around the complexity of a single workflow is to have separate workflows for different environments, making sure that only the artifacts created and validated are promoted from one environment to another, as well as, the workflow is small enough, to debug any issues seen in any of the workflows. In this case, the state and environment values need to be passed from one deployment environment to another. Multiple workflows also helps to keep the deployments to the environments independent thus reducing the time to deploy and find issues earlier than later in the process. Also, since the environments are independent of each other, any failures in deploying to one environment does not block deployments to other environments. One tradeoff in this method, is that with different workflows for each environment, the maintenance increases as the complexity of workflows increase over time.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"playbook/continuous_delivery/recipes/github_workflows/github_workflows/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub Actions</li> <li>GitHub Workflows</li> </ul>"},{"location":"playbook/continuous_delivery/recipes/terraform/save_output_to_variable_group/","title":"Save terraform output to a variable group (Azure DevOps)","text":"<p>This recipe applies only to terraform usage with Azure DevOps.

You can also add here any other relevant details you might have. The example folder can include one or more examples of how to use the module, each example having the same set of configuration files decided on the previous step.

The general convention is to use lowercase letters and numbers, with underscores instead of dashes, for example: \"azurerm_resource_group\". When naming resources, start with the provider's name, followed by the target resource, separated by underscores. For instance, \"azurerm_postgresql_server\" is an appropriate name for an Azure provider resource. When it comes to data sources, use a similar naming convention, but make sure to use plural names for lists of items. For example, \"azurerm_resource_groups\" is a good name for a data source that represents a list of resource groups. Variable and output names should be descriptive and reflect the purpose or use of the variable. It's also helpful to group related items together using a common prefix. For example, all variables related to storage accounts could start with \"storage_\". Keep in mind that outputs should be understandable outside of their scope. A useful naming pattern to follow is \"{name}_{attribute}\", where \"name\" represents a resource or data source name, and \"attribute\" is the attribute returned by the output. For example, \"storage_primary_connection_string\" could be a valid output name.</p> <p>Make sure you include a description for outputs and variables, as well as marking the values as 'default' or 'sensitive' when the case.

Avoid overlapping with on-premises or other cloud networks.</li> <li>Use CIDR notation: Use Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation to define the VNet address space, which allows more efficient allocation and prevents wasting IP addresses.</li> <li>Use subnets: Divide your VNets into smaller subnets based on security, application, or environment requirements. This allows for better network management and security.</li> <li>Consider leaving a buffer between VNets: While it's not strictly necessary, leaving a buffer between VNets can be beneficial in some cases, especially when you anticipate future growth or when you might need to merge VNets.

Typically, we meet the customer where they are at (for example, using their Confluence instance to land documentation if that is their preferred process). However, similar to storing decision logs, trade studies, etc. in the development repo, there are also large benefits to maintaining design review artifacts in the repo as well. Usually these artifacts can be further added to root level documentation directory or even at the root of the corresponding project if the repo is monolithic. In adding them to the project repo, these artifacts must similarly be reviewed in Pull Requests (typically preceding but sometimes accompanying implementation) which allows async review/discussion.

The dotnet app includes <code>stylecop</code> which fails the build in case of linting issues.</p> <p>Next we will also create a dockerfile to perform an end-to-end test. Usually this will look like a set of scripts, or a dedicated app which performs actual HTTP calls to a running application. For the sake of simplicity the dockerfile itself will run a simple curl command:</p> <pre><code>FROM alpine:3.7\nRUN apk --no-cache add curl\nENTRYPOINT [\"curl\",\"0.0.0.0:8080/weatherforecast\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Now we are ready to combine both of the dockerfiles in a docker-compose script:</p> <pre><code>version: '3'\nservices:\n  app:\n    image: app:0.01\n    build:\n      context: .\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:80\"\n  e2e:\n    image: e2e:0.01\n    build:\n      context: ./E2E\n</code></pre> <p>The docker-compose script will launch the 2 dockerfiles, and it will build them if they were not built before. The following command will run docker compose:</p> <pre><code>docker-compose up --build -d\n</code></pre> <p>Once the images are up, you can make calls to the service. The e2e image will perform the set of e2e tests. If you want to skip the tests, you can simply tell compose to run a specific service by appending the name of the service, as follows:</p> <pre><code>docker-compose up --build -d app\n</code></pre> <p>Now you have a local script which builds and tests you application. The next step would be make your CI run the docker-compose script.</p> <p>Here is an example of a yaml file used by Azure DevOps pipelines:</p> <pre><code>trigger:\n- master\n\npool:\n  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n\nvariables:\n  solution: '**/*.sln'\n  buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'\n  buildConfiguration: 'Release'\n\nsteps:\n- task: DockerCompose@0\n  displayName: Build, Test, E2E\n  inputs:\n    action: Run services\n    dockerComposeFile: docker-compose.yml\n- script: dotnet restore SampleApp\n- script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration) SampleApp\n  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'\n</code></pre> <p>In this script the first step is docker-compose, which uses the same file we created the previous steps. The next steps, do the same using scripts, and are here for comparison.

To enforce this, it's a good idea to enforce the use of StyleCop. There are a few steps that will give you an easy start with this.</p> <p>First, you can use the Directory.Build.props file in the /src folder in combination with the files in the build/dotnet folder. By having this, you enforce StyleCop in all Visual Studio project files in it's sub folders with a configuration of which rules should be used or ignored. You can tailor this to your needs of course. For more information, see Customize your build and Use rule sets to group code analysis rules.</p> <p>To make sure developers are forced to add the triple-slash comments by throwing compiler errors and to have the proper settings for the generation of documentation XML-files, add the TreatWarningsAsErrors and GenerateDocumentationFile settings to every .csproj file. You can add that in the first PropertyGroup settings like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;true&lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;\n    &lt;TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;true&lt;/TreatWarningsAsErrors&gt;\n  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\n\n    ...\n&lt;/Project&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now you are all set to generate documentation from your C# code.

This baseline is the reference point your model needs to outperform. A well-defined baseline is different for each problem type and there is no one size fits all approach.</p> <p>As an example, let's consider some common types of machine learning problems:</p> <ul> <li>Classification: Predicting between a positive and a negative class. Either the class with the most observations or a simple logistic regression model can be the baseline.</li> <li>Regression: Predicting the house prices in a city. The average house price for the last year or last month, a simple linear regression model, or the previous median house price in a neighborhood could be the baseline.</li> <li>Image classification: Building an image classifier to distinguish between cats and no cats in an image. If your classes are unbalanced: 70% cats and 30% no cats and if you always predict cats, your naive classifier has 70% accuracy and this can be your baseline. If your classes are balanced: 52% cats and 48% no cats, then a simple convolutional architecture can be the baseline (1 conv layer + 1 max pooling + 1 dense). Additionally, human accuracy at labelling can also be the baseline in an image classification scenario.</li> </ul> <p>Some questions to ask when comparing to a baseline:</p> <ul> <li>How does your model compare to a random guess?</li> <li>How does your model performance compare to applying a simple threshold?</li> <li>How does your model compare with always predicting the most common value?</li> </ul> <p>Note: In some cases, human parity might be too ambitious as a baseline, but this should be decided on a case by case basis. Human accuracy is one of the available options, but not the only one.</p> <p>Resources:</p> <ul> <li>\"How To Get Baseline Results And Why They Matter\" article</li> <li>\"Always start with a stupid model, no exceptions.\" article</li> </ul>"},{"location":"playbook/machine_learning/ml_model_checklist/#are-machine-learning-performance-metrics-defined-for-both-training-and-scoring","title":"Are machine learning performance metrics defined for both training and scoring?","text":"<p>The methodology of translating the training metrics to scoring metrics should be well-defined and understood. Depending on the data type and model, the model metrics calculation might differ in production and in training. For example, the training procedure calculated metrics for a long period of time (a year, a decade) with different seasonal characteristics while the scoring procedure will calculate the metrics per a restricted time interval (for example a week, a month, a quarter). Well-defined ML performance metrics are essential in production so that a decrease or increase in model performance can be accurately detected.</p> <p>Things to consider:</p> <ul> <li>In forecasting, if you change the period of assessing the performance, from one month to a year for example, then you might get a different result. For example, if your model is predicting sales of a product per day and the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is very low for the first month the model is in production.

These are three main patterns as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Automatic telemetry: Support for automatic instrumentation is available for some languages. OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation (100% codeless) is typically done through library hooks or monkey-patching library code. Automatic instrumentation will intercept all interactions and dependencies and automatically send the telemetry to the configured exporters. More information about this concept can be found in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation doc.</li> <li>Manual tracing: This must be done by coding using the OpenTelemetry SDK, managing the <code>tracer</code> objects to obtain Spans, and forming instrumented OpenTelemetry Scopes to identify the code segments to be manually traced. Also, by using the @WithSpan annotations (method decorations in C# and Java) to mark whole methods that will be automatically traced.</li> <li>Hybrid approach: Most Production-ready scenarios will require a mix of both techniques, using the automatic instrumentation to collect automatic telemetry and the OpenTelemetry SDK to identify code segments that are important to instrument manually. When considering production-ready scenarios, the hybrid approach is the way to go as it allows for a throughout cover over the whole solution.

The collector has two different deployment strategies \u2013 either running as an agent alongside a service or as a gateway which is a remote application. In general, using both is recommended: the agent would be deployed with your service and run as a separate process or in a sidecar; meanwhile, the collector would be deployed separately, as its own application running in a container or virtual machine. Each agent would forward telemetry data to the collector, which could then export it to a variety of backend systems such as Lightstep, Jaeger, or Prometheus. The agent can be also replaced with the automatic instrumentation if supported. The automatic instrumentation provides the collector capabilities of retrieving, processing and exporting the telemetry.</p> <p>Regardless of how you choose to instrument or deploy OpenTelemetry, exporters provide powerful options for reporting telemetry data.

Add authentication in all IoTEdge modules. 2 Confidentiality and Integrity As a result of the vulnerability of not encrypting data, plaintext data could be intercepted during transit via a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Sensitive data could be exposed or tampered with to allow further exploits. All products and services must encrypt data in transit using approved cryptographic protocols and algorithms.  Use TLS to encrypt all HTTP-based network traffic. Use other mechanisms, such as IPSec, to encrypt non-HTTP network traffic that contains customer or confidential data. Applies to data flow from browser to IoTEdge modules. 3 Confidentiality Data is a valuable target for most threat actors and attacking the data store directly, as opposed to stealing it during transit, allows data exfiltration at a much larger scale. In our scenario we are storing some data in Azure Blob containers. All customer or confidential data must be encrypted before being written to non-volatile storage media (encrypted at-rest) per the following requirements.  Use approved algorithms. This includes AES-256, AES-192, or AES-128. Encryption must be enabled before writing data to storage.  Applies to all data stores on the diagram. Azure Storage encrypt data at rest by default (AES-256). 4 Confidentiality Broken or non-existent authentication mechanisms may allow attackers to gain access to confidential information. All services within the Azure Trust Boundary must authenticate all incoming requests, including requests coming from the same network. Proper authorizations should also be applied to prevent unnecessary privileges.  Whenever available, use Azure Managed Identities to authenticate services. Service Principals may be used if Managed Identities are not supported. External users or services may use UserName + Passwords, Tokens, Certificates or Connection Strings to authenticate, provided these are stored on Key Vault or any other vaulting solution. For authorization, use Azure RBAC to segregate duties and grant only the least amount of access to perform an action at a particular scope. Applies to Azure services like Azure IoTHub, Azure Cognitive Service, Azure Application Insights are authenticated using connection strings. 5 Confidentiality and Integrity A large attack surface, particularly those that are exposed on the internet, will increase the probability of a compromise Minimize the application attack surface by limiting publicly exposed services.  Use strong network controls by using virtual networks, subnets and network security groups to protect against unsolicited traffic. Use Azure Private Endpoint for Azure Storage.  Applies to Azure storage. 6 Confidentiality and Integrity Browser and IoTEdge device are connected over in store WIFI network Minimize the attack on WIFI network by using secure algorithm like WPA2. Applies to connection between browser and IoTEdge devices. 7 Integrity Exploitation of insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident. Attackers rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to achieve their goals without being detected. Logging of critical application events must be performed to ensure that, should a security incident occur, incident response and root-cause analysis may be done. Steps must also be taken to ensure that logs are available and cannot be overwritten or destroyed through malicious or accidental occurrences. At a minimum, the following events should be logged. Login/logout events Privilege delegation events Security validation failures (e.g. input validation or authorization check failures) Application errors and system events Application and system start-ups and shut-downs, as well as logging initialization 6 Availability Exploitation of the public endpoint by malicious actors who aim to render the service unavailable to its intended users by interrupting the service normal activity, for instance by flooding the target service with requests until normal traffic is unable to be processed (Denial of Service) Application is accessed via web app deployed as one of the IoTEdge modules on the IoTEdge device. This app can be accessed by anyone in the local area network. Hence DDoS attacks are possible if the attacker gained access to local area network. All services deployed as IoTEdge modules must use authentication. Applies to services deployed on IoTEdge device 7 Integrity Tampering with data Data at rest, in Azure Storage must be encrypted on disk. Data at rest, in Azure can be protected further by Azure Advanced Threat Protection. Data at rest, in Azure Storage and Azure monitor workspace will use Azure RBAC to segregate duties and grant only the least amount of access to perform an action at a particular scope. Data in motion between services can be encrypted in TLS 1.2 Applies to data flow between IoTEdge modules and Azure Services."},{"location":"playbook/security/threat_modelling_example/#security-principles","title":"Security Principles","text":"<ul> <li>Confidentiality refers to the objective of keeping data private or secret.
